    <title><ulink url="http://www.bramstein.com/projects/jlayout/">jQuery 1.3
    support for jLayout</ulink></title>

    <subtitle>Posted on Saturday 17 January 2009</subtitle>

    <para>Happy belated new year! It has been a while since I posted; moving
    twice, starting a new job, and writing your thesis simultaneously tends to
    do that. Things seem to be calming down now, and I hope to finish and
    release two new projects soon. In the meantime I've set up a <ulink
    type="" url="http://groups.google.com/group/jlayout/">support group for
    the jLayout library</ulink> for general discussion and support. I have
    also tested both <ulink
    url="http://www.bramstein.com/projects/jlayout/">jLayout</ulink> and
    <ulink url="http://www.bramstein.com/projects/jsizes/">JSizes</ulink> with
    the new <ulink
    url="http://blog.jquery.com/2009/01/14/jquery-13-and-the-jquery-foundation/">jQuery
    1.3 release</ulink>. Neither required any changes, so no new release. I
    did however remove the “experimental” warning on the jLayout plugin page,
    and consider it stable and reasonably well tested―it works in all major
    browsers including Internet Explorer 6.</para>

    <title><ulink url="http://www.bramstein.com/projects/jfun/">Functional
    Pattern Matching in JavaScript</ulink></title>

    <subtitle>Posted on Sunday 05 October 2008</subtitle>

    <para>I've turned the articles on pattern matching in JavaScript into a
    library. The code is completely rewritten, shorter, more efficient, better
    tested and no longer depends on the Junify unification library. Please see
    the <ulink type="" url="http://www.bramstein.com/projects/jfun/">project
    page</ulink> for details on the syntax, documentation and examples.</para>

    <title><ulink url="http://www.bramstein.com/projects/jlayout/">New jLayout
    algorithm &amp; IE6 support</ulink></title>

    <subtitle>Posted on Saturday 04 October 2008</subtitle>

    <para>I've uploaded a new version of <ulink
    url="http://www.bramstein.com/projects/jlayout/">jLayout</ulink>, with
    support for a new layout algorithm called ‘flex-grid’. The flex-grid
    algorithm allows you to lay out components in a grid with flexible column
    and row sizes. The <ulink
    url="http://www.bramstein.com/projects/jlayout/jquery-plugin.html">jLayout
    jQuery plugin</ulink> has also been updated and now supports Internet
    Explorer 6 (in standards mode). Support for IE6 brought up a small bug in
    the <ulink url="http://www.bramstein.com/projects/jsizes/">JSizes jQuery
    plugin</ulink>, which has now been corrected as well.</para>

    support for XSLTJSON</ulink></title>

    <subtitle>Posted on Wednesday 03 September 2008</subtitle>

    <para>The XSLTJSON project now supports <ulink
    url="http://onperl.org/blog/onperl/page/rayfish">Micheal Matthew's Rayfish
    convention</ulink> for converting XML to JSON. The Rayfish convention
    creates highly structured JSON from your XML, and is a good choice when
    dealing with data centric XML files. Additionally I've created unit tests
    for all supported output formats and made sure that all are
    passing.</para>

    <title>JavaScript Pattern Matching &amp; JUnify, jLayout updates</title>

    <subtitle>Posted on Tuesday 12 August 2008</subtitle>

    <para>I've uploaded a new article on <ulink
    url="http://www.bramstein.com/articles/advanced-pattern-matching.html">advanced
    functional pattern matching in JavaScript</ulink>. The article introduces
    a simplified pattern matching syntax, and shows how to use it with
    algebraic data types. There are also new versions of the <ulink
    url="http://www.bramstein.com/projects/junify/">JUnify library</ulink> and
    the <ulink url="http://www.bramstein.com/projects/jlayout/">jLayout
    library</ulink>. The new JUnify version contains a small modification to
    work together with <ulink
    url="http://w3future.com/weblog/stories/2008/06/16/adtinjs.xml">Sjoerd
    Visscher's algebraic data type library</ulink>, and the jLayout library
    now includes support for Safari 3.</para>

    Layout Algorithms &amp; jQuery plugin</ulink></title>

    <subtitle>Posted on Monday 4 August 2008</subtitle>

    <para>The <ulink url="http://www.bramstein.com/projects/jlayout/">jLayout
    JavaScript library</ulink> provides layout algorithms for laying out
    components and containers. The library currently provides two layout
    algorithms: border, which lays out components in five different regions
    and grid, which lays out components in a user defined grid. An <ulink
    url="http://www.bramstein.com/projects/jlayout/jquery-plugin.html"
    userlevel="">experimental jQuery plugin</ulink> to lay out (X)HTML
    elements is also available.</para>

    <title><ulink url="http://www.bramstein.com/projects/junify/">JUnify
    unification library</ulink></title>

    <subtitle>Posted on Friday 1 August 2008</subtitle>

    <para>JUnify is a JavaScript library for performing unification on objects
    and arrays. Unification is an algorithm to determine the substitutions
    needed to make two expressions match. If the expressions contain
    variables, these will be bound to values in order for the match to
    succeed. If two expressions are not identical or the variables can not be
    bound, the match fails. Unification can, for example, be used to implement
    <ulink

    matching</ulink>, <ulink
    url="http://www.bramstein.com/articles/extracting-object-values.html">object
    property extraction</ulink>, or an expert system.</para>

    <title><ulink url="http://www.bramstein.com/projects/jsizes/">JSizes
    jQuery plugin</ulink></title>

    <subtitle>Posted on Saturday 26 July 2008</subtitle>

    <para>JSizes is a small plugin for the jQuery JavaScript library which
    adds support for the CSS min-width, min-height, max-width, max-height,
    border-*-width, margin, and padding properties. Additionally it has one
    method for determining whether an element is visible. Because all the size
    methods return numbers, it is safe to use them in calculating DOM element
    dimensions.</para>
