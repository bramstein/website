    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>These are highres Quake1 menu textures for use with <ulink
    url="http://wiki.quakesrc.org/index.php/Engines">modern Quake1
    engines</ulink> such as <ulink
    url="http://www.icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/">Darkplaces</ulink>. The
    design goal for these textures was to make them as close to the original
    textures as possible, but with a higher resolution. The textures are made
    at 1024x768 resolution and mostly use vector graphics and blend modes so
    that they can be easily resized without (major) quality loss. I was
    originally planning to port my <ulink url="/gui/">Gui library</ulink> to
    Quake, and needed some high resolution menu textures, hence these
    textures. However, due to a serious lack of time, these textures are all I
    have (at the moment). The download includes PNG files and the original
    Photoshop (PSD) files.</para>
