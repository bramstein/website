# The Science of Typography
<p class="subtitle">13 November, 2015</p>

This is going to be a weird talk. You’ve probably all seen automated “design” software and algorithms come and go. They promise the sky but often restrict you and produce bland and generic results. Should you not use such software at all? What if there are tools that analyse and guide you to create better designs? This talk will explore typographic analysis and what we as designers can learn from math and computer science.

I gave the talk on November 13 at the [dsgnday conference](http://dsgnday.nl/) in Amsterdam.

# Web Fonts Performance
<p class="subtitle">14 September, 2015</p>

Web fonts are great. They are also be really bad for front-end performance because they block rendering. You may have experienced this on a slow cellular network. Staring at a blank page is no fun, especially when the content has already loaded.

This talk explores why browsers have placed fonts on the critical path, and how we can work around this while still delivering a good user experience. It also takes a look at what the future will bring to web font performance: preloading hints, the font-display property, and <abbr>HTTP/2</abbr>.

I gave this talk at Smashing Conf Freiburg. A <a href="https://vimeo.com/140641362">video recording of the talk</a> is also available.

# The Consequences of Web Fonts
<p class="subtitle">20 March, 2015</p>

In the last few years the number of sites using web fonts has soared. Unfortunately the default behaviour of most browsers is to hide text while downloading fonts. This talk explores how to embrace the Flash Of Unstyled Text (<abbr>FOUT</abbr>) and avoid the devastating effects of the Flash Of Invisible Text (<abbr>FOIT</abbr>).

I gave this talk at [UX Munich 2015](http://2015.uxmunich.com/) in Munich, Germany.

# The State of Web Type
<p class="subtitle">September 12, 2014</p>

In this talk I explore advanced web typography using <abbr>CSS</abbr>, <abbr>HTML</abbr>, and JavaScript polyfills. It dives deep into the current state of browser support for kerning, hyphenation, justification, and OpenType features. The talk provides an overview of new typographic <abbr>CSS</abbr> features, how to use them, and when to expect them.

I first gave this talk at [CSSConf EU](http://2014.cssconf.eu/), and an extended version at Adobe MAX 2014 and [Webfontday Munich](http://webfontday.de/en/webfontday-2014). This talk resulted in the creation of the [State of Web Type](http://stateofwebtype.com/), which contains up-to-date browser support data for web type.

# Type Rendering
<p class="subtitle">November 3, 2013</p>

What is in a web font? Find out how it affects type rendering on different browsers and platforms, and how you can use that knowledge to choose appropriate typefaces.
