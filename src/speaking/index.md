# Are variable fonts the future of web typography?

You may have heard about variable fonts and how amazing they are. But what exactly are variable fonts, and why are so many people excited about them? Is it because they offer exciting new ways to animate type? Or to endlessly tweak your typography? Or are they the answer to all your webfont performance problems? In this talk I explore all these questions and try to answer that question (hint: Yes!)

Presented at the [CSS Minks JS conference](https://css-minsk-js.by/) (Minsk, Belarus.)


# Line Breaking, Justification, and Variable Fonts

I explain how line breaking and justification works, and how variable fonts will improve justified text even further.

Presented at the [Robothon Conference 2018](http://typemedia.org/robothon/) (The Hague, The Netherlands.)

# The Big Web Show podcast: Webfont Festival with Bram Stein

I join Jeffrey Zeldman on the Big Web Show to talk about web fonts, font stacks, variable fonts, and of course my new book: the [Webfont Handbook](https://abookapart.com/products/webfont-handbook).

# Responsive Web Design podcast: Variable Fonts

My colleague [Tim Brown](http://tbrown.org/) and I joined Ethan Marcotte on the [Responsive Web Design podcast](https://responsivewebdesign.com/podcast/) to talk about variable fonts. We talked about what variable fonts are, and how they will affect responsive design and web performance.

# The Science of Typography

This is a weird talk. You’ve probably all seen automated “design” software and algorithms come and go. They promise the sky but often restrict you and produce bland and generic results. Should you not use such software at all? What if there are tools that analyse and guide you to create better designs? This talk will explore typographic analysis and what we as designers can learn from math and computer science.

I gave this talk at the following conferences:

* [Design It; Build it](http://www.dibiconference.com/): Edinburgh, Scotland (2017).
* [One Day Out](https://2016.onedayout.io/): Odense, Denmark (2016).
* [Dsgnday conference](http://dsgnday.nl/): Amsterdam, the Netherlands (2015).

# Web Fonts Performance

Web fonts are great. They are also be really bad for front-end performance because they block rendering. You may have experienced this on a slow cellular network. Staring at a blank page is no fun, especially when the content has already loaded.

This talk explores why browsers have placed fonts on the critical path, and how we can work around this while still delivering a good user experience. It also takes a look at what the future will bring to web font performance: preloading hints, the font-display property, and <abbr>HTTP/2</abbr>.

I gave this talk at the following conferences:

* [Fronteers](https://fronteers.nl/congres/2016-spring): Amsterdam, the Netherlands (2016).
* [AtTheFrontend](http://atthefrontend.dk/): Copenhagen, Denmark (2016).
* [WebDevCon](http://webdevcon.com/): Seattle, United States (2016).
* [Smashing Conf](https://smashingconf.com/freiburg-2015/): Freiburg, Germany (2015).

# The Consequences of Web Fonts

In the last few years the number of sites using web fonts has soared. Unfortunately the default behaviour of most browsers is to hide text while downloading fonts. This talk explores how to embrace the Flash Of Unstyled Text (<abbr>FOUT</abbr>) and avoid the devastating effects of the Flash Of Invisible Text (<abbr>FOIT</abbr>).

I gave this talk at [UX Munich 2015](http://2015.uxmunich.com/) in Munich, Germany.

# The State of Web Type

In this talk I explore advanced web typography using <abbr>CSS</abbr>, <abbr>HTML</abbr>, and JavaScript polyfills. It dives deep into the current state of browser support for kerning, hyphenation, justification, and OpenType features. The talk provides an overview of new typographic <abbr>CSS</abbr> features, how to use them, and when to expect them.

I gave this talk at the following conferences:

* [Adobe MAX](http://2014.max.adobe.com/): Los Angeles, United States (2014).
* [Web Font Day](http://webfontday.de/en/webfontday-2014): Munich, Germany (2014).
* [CSSConf EU](http://2014.cssconf.eu/): Berlin, Germany (2014).

This talk resulted in the creation of the [State Of Web Type](http://stateofwebtype.com).

# Type Rendering

What is in a web font? Find out how it affects type rendering on different browsers and platforms, and how you can use that knowledge to choose appropriate typefaces.

I gave this talk at the Lat55 meetup, in Malmö, Sweden.
