# The Consequences of Web Fonts
<p class="subtitle">20 March, 2015</p>

In the last few years the number of sites using web fonts has soared. Unfortunately the default behaviour of most browsers is to hide text while downloading fonts. This talk explores how to embrace the Flash Of Unstyled Text (<abbr>FOUT</abbr>) and avoid the devastating effects of the Flash Of Invisible Text (<abbr>FOIT</abbr>).

I gave this talk at [UX Munich 2015](http://2015.uxmunich.com/) in Munich, Germany.

# The State of Web Type
<p class="subtitle">September 12, 2014</p>

In this talk I explore advanced web typography using <abbr>CSS</abbr>, <abbr>HTML</abbr>, and JavaScript polyfills. It dives deep into the current state of browser support for kerning, hyphenation, justification, and OpenType features. The talk provides an overview of new typographic <abbr>CSS</abbr> features, how to use them, and when to expect them.

I first gave this talk at [CSSConf EU](http://2014.cssconf.eu/), and an extended version at Adobe MAX 2014 and [Webfontday Munich](http://webfontday.de/en/webfontday-2014). This talk resulted in the creation of the [State of Web Type](http://stateofwebtype.com/), which contains up-to-date browser support data for web type.

# Type Rendering
<p class="subtitle">November 3, 2013</p>

What is in a web font? Find out how it affects type rendering on different browsers and platforms, and how you can use that knowledge to choose appropriate typefaces.
