# Preload Hints For Web Fonts
<p class=subtitle>August 7, 2015</p>

Web fonts are a popular topic in the web performance community. However, one fundamental problem is often overlooked: web fonts are lazy loaded. Can web font preload hints help us? [Continue reading…](preload-hints-for-web-fonts.html)

# Detecting System Fonts Without Flash
<p class="subtitle">July 30, 2015</p>

Many web-based text ed­i­tors allow the user to se­lect cus­tom fonts through a drop down menu. These font menus of­ten in­clude sys­tem fonts. Un­for­tu­nately, there is no web plat­form API for re­triev­ing a list of lo­cally in­stalled fonts.

# Smashing Book 5: Web Fonts Performance
<p class="subtitle">July 28, 2015</p>

Smashing Magazine asked me to write a chapter about web fonts performance for [Smashing Book 5](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/03/real-life-responsive-web-design-smashing-book-5/). I think web fonts are great, but they suffer from one big problem: by default they block rendering in almost all browsers. You may have experienced this yourself on a site using web fonts while using a slow cellular network. Staring at a blank page is no fun, especially when the content has already loaded.

Blocking rendering while downloading fonts is wrong and against the very idea of progressive enhancement. After all, the content is what people come for. Web fonts are an enhancement of that content. Important, but not critical. This chapter will show you how to optimise web fonts and how to load them without inconveniencing your visitors.

# Dev.Opera: State of Web Type
<p class="subtitle">March 3, 2015</p>

Typography has a long and rich history, but much has been lost in the transition to the web. Even though browser support for typography has improved a lot in the last few years, there are still many features that are unsupported.

Opera asked me to write an overview of the state of web type for their [Dev.Opera blog](https://dev.opera.com/). The article covers browser support for OpenType features, font loading, and hyphenation and justification (or the lack thereof).

# PAGE Magazine: Web Fonts
<p class="subtitle">October 1, 2014</p>

What exactly is a web font? Are web fonts different from desktop fonts? What do you need pay attention to when purchasing fonts? My article in the October 2014 issue of [PAGE Magazine](http://page-online.de/) answers these questions and more.

The issue also features other articles on web fonts and web typography and can be ordered at the [PAGE Magazine web shop](http://shop.page-online.de/einzelhefte/page-8-2014-webtypo-gestaltung-technik-corporate-design-food-packaging-task-management). The issue is only available in German.

# 8 Faces Magazine: Hyphenation & Justification
<p class="subtitle">October 6, 2013</p>

Justification has always been a source of contention on the web. Should you justify text, or shouldn’t you? To find out why there is such a disagreement, I take a closer look at what justification is, how it is implemented, and why browsers make the choice even more difficult.

This article appeared in issue #7 of [8 Faces magazine](http://www.8faces.com/). Unfortunately the issue (and magazine) is out of print, but it will be [available in book form](http://www.8faces.com/) later this year.
