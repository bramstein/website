# Smashing Book 5: Web Fonts Performance
<p class="subtitle">March 31, 2015</p>

Web fonts are great. They are also a problem because they block rendering. This effectively hides content from your users until your fonts have downloaded. You may have experienced this problem yourself while visiting a site using web fonts on a slow cellular network. The decision by most browsers to have fonts block rendering is opposite to the tenets of progressive enhancement. Content should come first and web fonts are an enhancement.

[Smashing Magazine](https://smashingmagazine.com/) asked me to write a chapter about web fonts for Smashing Book #5. The chapter starts with the basics: the <code>@font-face</code> syntax, the various font formats, and ends with a detailed explanation of how browsers load fonts. The next section covers basic optimisations for making your fonts load faster, such as caching, compression, inlining, and subsetting. The final section introduces the new <abbr>CSS</abbr> font loading <abbr>API</abbr> and several strategies for getting consistent and efficient cross-browser font loading that avoids blocking rendering.

The book can be purchased at the [Smashing Magazine web shop](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/books/) in hardcover and eBook versions. The author (and reviewer) line-up is amazing, so I highly recommend getting a copy.

# Dev.Opera: State of Web Type
<p class="subtitle">March 3, 2015</p>

Typography has a long and rich history, but much has been lost in the transition to the web. Even though browser support for typography has improved a lot in the last few years, there are still many features that are unsupported.

Opera asked me to write an overview of the state of web type for their [Dev.Opera blog](https://dev.opera.com/). The article covers browser support for OpenType features, font loading, and hyphenation and justification (or the lack thereof).

# PAGE Magazine: Web Fonts
<p class="subtitle">October 1, 2014</p>

What exactly is a web font? Are web fonts different from desktop fonts? What do you need pay attention to when purchasing fonts? My article in the October 2014 issue of [PAGE Magazine](http://page-online.de/) answers these questions and more.

# 8 Faces Magazine: Hyphenation & Justification
<p class="subtitle">October 6, 2013</p>

Justification has always been a source of contention on the web. Should you justify text, or shouldn’t you? To find out why there is such a disagreement, I take a closer look at what justification is, how it is implemented, and why browsers make the choice even more difficult.
