# Web Font Anti-Patterns
<p class="subtitle">October 13, 2015</p>

<p class=intro>Almost every web developer has used web fonts. Unfortunately, there is a lot of confusion about web fonts. Are they really bad for performance? Maybe you should not use web fonts at all?</p>

Fear not, this series of articles takes a look at some of the most common anti-patterns for creating, using, and loading web fonts. Web fonts can be great when used correctly and with moderation. There is no need to block web fonts or disable them on mobile devices. However, we — as web developers — must do a better job of using web fonts correctly.

Hopefully this series of web font anti-patterns will help clarify existing practices (good and bad) and guide you towards better web font usage. The anti-patterns (in no particular order):

1. [Overusing web fonts](web-font-anti-patterns-overusing.html)
2. [Inlining fonts](web-font-anti-patterns-inlining.html)
3. [Aggressive subsetting](web-font-anti-patterns-subsetting.html)
4. [Using local fonts](web-font-anti-patterns-local-fonts.html)
5. Reimplementing caching (coming soon)
6. Not styling fallback fonts (coming soon)
7. …

Do you have a web font anti-pattern that you’d like to see added? Do you have questions or comments? Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bram_stein).
