# Smashing Book 5: Web Fonts Performance
<p class="subtitle">March 31, 2015</p>

Web fonts are great. They are also a problem because they block rendering. This effectively hides content from your users until your fonts have downloaded. You may have experienced this problem yourself while visiting a site using web fonts on a slow cellular network. The decision by most browsers to have fonts block rendering is opposite to the tenets of progressive enhancement. Content should come first and web fonts are an enhancement.

Smashing Magazine asked me to write a chapter about web fonts for [Smashing Book #5](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/03/real-life-responsive-web-design-smashing-book-5/). The chapter starts with the basics: the <code>@font-face</code> syntax, the various font formats, and ends with a detailed explanation of how browsers load fonts. The next section covers basic optimisations for making your fonts load faster, such as caching, compression, inlining, and subsetting. The final section introduces the new <abbr>CSS</abbr> font loading <abbr>API</abbr> and several strategies for getting consistent and efficient cross-browser font loading that avoids blocking rendering.

# The State Of Web Type
<p class="subtitle">November 21, 2014</p>

The [State of Web Type](http://stateofwebtype.com/) contains up to date browser support data for type and typographic features. I created the State of Web Type because no other browser support data site goes into the necessary detail for type and typography features.

The site is frequently updated with new data and entirely open source. Any additions, corrections, or comments are very welcome.
