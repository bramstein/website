# Net Magazine: CSS font loading API
<p class="subtitle">February 23, 2017</p>

I wrote a short introduction to the CSS font loading API for the April 2017 issue of [Net Magazine](http://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine). The article highlights the most useful parts of the API and how it can be used to load web fonts asynchronously.

# Responsive Web Design podcast: Variable Fonts
<p class="subtitle">January 31, 2017</p>

My colleague Tim Brown and I joined Ethan Marcotte on the [Responsive Web Design podcast](https://responsivewebdesign.com/podcast/) to talk about variable fonts. We talked about what variable fonts are, and how they will affect responsive design and web performance.

# Performance Calendar 2016: Loading Web Fonts Asynchronously
<p class="subtitle">December 21, 2016</p>

The Web Performance Calendar is a recurring advent calendar focused on web performance. I wrote an [article on loading web fonts asynchronously](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2016/loading-web-fonts-asynchronously/) for the 2016 calendar. The article concisely describes why web font performance matters, and how to use [Font Face Observer](https://fontfaceobserver.com) to get the best possible performance and user experience.

# Web Font Loading Patterns
<p class=subtitle>April 13, 2016</p>

Web font loading may seem complicated, but it is actually quite simple if you follow some simple font loading patterns. By combining patterns you can create custom font loading behaviours that work in all browsers. [Continue reading…](/writing/web-font-loading-patterns.html)

# Web Font Anti-Patterns
<p class=subtitle>October 13, 2015</p>

There is a lot of confusion about web fonts. Are they really bad for performance? Maybe you should not use web fonts at all? This ongoing series of articles takes a look at some of the most common anti-patterns for creating, using, and loading web fonts. Web fonts can be great when used correctly and with moderation.

# Preload Hints For Web Fonts
<p class=subtitle>August 7, 2015</p>

Web fonts are a popular topic in the web performance community. However, one fundamental problem is often overlooked: web fonts are lazy loaded. Can web font preload hints help us? [Continue reading…](/writing/preload-hints-for-web-fonts.html)

# Detecting System Fonts Without Flash
<p class="subtitle">July 30, 2015</p>

Many web-based text ed­i­tors allow the user to se­lect cus­tom fonts through a drop down menu. These font menus of­ten in­clude sys­tem fonts. Un­for­tu­nately, there is no web plat­form API for re­triev­ing a list of lo­cally in­stalled fonts.

# Smashing Book 5: Web Fonts Performance
<p class="subtitle">July 28, 2015</p>

Smashing Magazine asked me to write a chapter about web fonts performance for [Smashing Book 5](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/03/real-life-responsive-web-design-smashing-book-5/). I think web fonts are great, but they suffer from one big problem: by default they block rendering in almost all browsers. You may have experienced this yourself on a site using web fonts while using a slow cellular network. Staring at a blank page is no fun, especially when the content has already loaded.

[![Smashing Book 5](/assets/images/smashing-book-5-pages.png)](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/03/real-life-responsive-web-design-smashing-book-5/)

Blocking rendering while downloading fonts is wrong and against the very idea of progressive enhancement. After all, the content is what people come for. Web fonts are an enhancement of that content. Important, but not critical. This chapter will show you how to optimise web fonts and how to load them without inconveniencing your visitors.

# The State Of Web Type
<p class="subtitle">November 21, 2014</p>

The [State of Web Type](http://stateofwebtype.com/) contains up to date browser support data for type and typographic features. I created the State of Web Type because no other browser support data site goes into the necessary detail for type and typography features.

[![State of Web Type](/assets/images/state-of-web-type-site.png)](http://stateofwebtype.com/)

The site is frequently updated with new data and entirely open source. Any additions, corrections, or comments are very welcome.
