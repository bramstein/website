# Web Font Anti-Patterns
<p class=subtitle>October 13, 2015</p>

There is a lot of confusion about web fonts. Are they really bad for performance? Maybe you should not use web fonts at all? This ongoing series of articles takes a look at some of the most common anti-patterns for creating, using, and loading web fonts. Web fonts can be great when used correctly and with moderation.

Web fonts are a popular topic in the web performance community. However, one fundamental problem is often overlooked: web fonts are lazy loaded. Can web font preload hints help us? [Continue reading…](/writing/preload-hints-for-web-fonts.html)

# Detecting System Fonts Without Flash
<p class="subtitle">July 30, 2015</p>

Many web-based text ed­i­tors allow the user to se­lect cus­tom fonts through a drop down menu. These font menus of­ten in­clude sys­tem fonts. Un­for­tu­nately, there is no web plat­form API for re­triev­ing a list of lo­cally in­stalled fonts.

# Smashing Book 5: Web Fonts Performance
<p class="subtitle">July 28, 2015</p>

Smashing Magazine asked me to write a chapter about web fonts performance for [Smashing Book 5](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/03/real-life-responsive-web-design-smashing-book-5/). I think web fonts are great, but they suffer from one big problem: by default they block rendering in almost all browsers. You may have experienced this yourself on a site using web fonts while using a slow cellular network. Staring at a blank page is no fun, especially when the content has already loaded.

Blocking rendering while downloading fonts is wrong and against the very idea of progressive enhancement. After all, the content is what people come for. Web fonts are an enhancement of that content. Important, but not critical. This chapter will show you how to optimise web fonts and how to load them without inconveniencing your visitors.

# The State Of Web Type
<p class="subtitle">November 21, 2014</p>

The [State of Web Type](http://stateofwebtype.com/) contains up to date browser support data for type and typographic features. I created the State of Web Type because no other browser support data site goes into the necessary detail for type and typography features.

The site is frequently updated with new data and entirely open source. Any additions, corrections, or comments are very welcome.
