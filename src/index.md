# Smashing Book 5: Web Fonts Performance
<p class="subtitle">July 28, 2015</p>

Smashing Magazine asked me to write a chapter about web fonts performance for [Smashing Book 5](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/03/real-life-responsive-web-design-smashing-book-5/). I think web fonts are great, but they suffer from one big problem: by default they block rendering in almost all browsers. You may have experienced this yourself on a site using web fonts while using a slow cellular network. Staring at a blank page is no fun, especially when the content has already loaded.

# The State Of Web Type
<p class="subtitle">November 21, 2014</p>

The [State of Web Type](http://stateofwebtype.com/) contains up to date browser support data for type and typographic features. I created the State of Web Type because no other browser support data site goes into the necessary detail for type and typography features.

The site is frequently updated with new data and entirely open source. Any additions, corrections, or comments are very welcome.
